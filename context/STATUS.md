## Current Phase

**Phase:** Core Feature Development
**Started:** 2025-12-07
**Target:** N/A (iterative development)

**Focus:** Building interactive map visualization with filtering and animation capabilities for 2,277 running activities

## Active Tasks

**In Progress:**
- None - awaiting user feedback

**Completed This Phase:**
- ✅ Interactive map visualization with Leaflet + Vue 3
- ✅ Load and parse 2,277 GPX files with progress indicator
- ✅ Date range filtering (start/end date picker)
- ✅ Location filtering (city, state, country dropdowns)
- ✅ Shoe emoji favicon
- ✅ Route animation with progressive drawing (5-60s duration)
- ✅ Hide static routes during animation

**Next Up:**
- Awaiting user feedback on current features
- Potential: Color coding by pace/distance/elevation
- Potential: Route clustering for dense areas
- Potential: Keyboard shortcuts for animation controls

## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Animation Architecture:** Progressive polyline drawing for full route visualization
- **Filter Combination:** Single computed property (filteredRuns) for efficient re-rendering
- **Location Data:** Pre-computed CSV for accuracy over auto-detection from GPS
- **Favicon:** Emoji (👟) over custom SVG after recognizability issues

**Pending Decisions:**
- None

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
- None - all features complete

**Mental Model:**
Application architecture: Data loading (CSV/GPX) → Filtering (date/location) → Visualization (static map or animated route). Animation uses time-based requestAnimationFrame loop with progressive polyline drawing. Static and animated routes are mutually exclusive display states.

**Next Specific Action:**
Await user feedback and direction for next features

## Recent Accomplishments

**Last Session (2025-12-07):**
- ✅ Date range and location filtering with modular components
- ✅ Integrated location data from CSV, auto-filtered treadmill runs
- ✅ Shoe emoji favicon after failed custom SVG attempts
- ✅ Progressive route animation with 5-60s configurable duration
- ✅ Hide static routes during animation

**Key Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/components/DateRangeFilter.vue` - Date range picker component
- `src/components/LocationFilter.vue` - City/state/country filter dropdowns
- `src/components/AnimationControls.vue` - Route animation control panel
- `src/utils/dataLoader.js` - Location data loading and treadmill filtering
- `src/App.vue` - Filter integration and animation implementation
- `public/favicon.svg` - Shoe emoji favicon

## Next Session

**Priority 1:** Await user feedback on filtering and animation features
**Priority 2:** Implement any requested enhancements or fixes
**Priority 3:** Explore performance optimizations if needed (clustering, lazy loading)

**Context Notes:**
- Dev server running on port 3300
- 8 commits ahead of origin/main (not pushed per user guidelines)
- All features working: filters, animation, location integration
- Treadmill runs automatically excluded from visualization
