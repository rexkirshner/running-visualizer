## Examples (Delete after reading)

### Example 1: Bug Report

## 2024-10-21 - /validate-context - Bug 🐛

**What happened**: Running `/validate-context` crashed when SESSIONS.md had emoji in session titles

**Expected behavior**: Validation should handle emoji in markdown files

**Actual behavior**: Got error "invalid byte sequence" and validation stopped

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Add emoji to session title: `## Session 5 | 2024-10-20 | 🚀 Launch`
2. Run `/validate-context`
3. Error appears

**Suggestion**: Add UTF-8 encoding handling to validation script

**Severity**: 🟡 Moderate (workaround: remove emoji from titles)

**Environment**:
- OS: macOS 14.5
- Claude Code: 1.2.0
- CCS: 2.3.0

---

### Example 2: Feature Request

## 2024-10-21 - /save - Feature Request ✨

**What happened**: Would love auto-save reminder after 30 minutes of work

**Expected behavior**: After 30 min without `/save`, gentle reminder appears

**Suggestion**: Add optional reminder in .context-config.json:
```json
"notifications": {
  "saveReminder": {
    "enabled": true,
    "intervalMinutes": 30
  }
}
```

**Severity**: 🟢 Minor (nice quality of life improvement)

**Environment**:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Claude Code: 1.1.5
- CCS: 2.3.0

### Example 3: Praise

## 2024-10-21 - /organize-docs - Praise 👍

**What happened**: The `/organize-docs` command is AMAZING! Cleaned up 20+ loose files in 2 minutes.

**Why it's great**:
- Interactive and smart (analyzed files before moving)
- Suggested good locations
- Dated historical files automatically
- Kept my project professional

**Suggestion**: None - this is perfect! Maybe add to README as a selling point?

**Severity**: 🟢 (just appreciation!)
