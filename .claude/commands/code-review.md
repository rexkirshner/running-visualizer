# /code-review Command

Conduct a thorough, unhurried code quality audit. This command **NEVER makes changes** - it only identifies issues and suggests improvements. Fixes happen in a separate session after review.

**Full guide:** `.claude/docs/code-review-guide.md`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

1. **NEVER make code changes during review** - This is analysis only
2. **Take your time** - No rushing, no time pressure
3. **Don't break anything** - If uncertain, note it, don't change it
4. **Separate concerns** - Review finds issues, fixes come later
5. **Be thorough** - This is when we have time to be comprehensive

**Why:** See "The No Changes Rule" in `.claude/docs/code-review-guide.md`

## When to Use This Command

**Good times:**
- After completing a feature or phase
- Before deployment or major milestones
- When quality matters more than speed
- **Only when you have plenty of time** - user will only run this when unbound by time

**Bad times:**
- Time is limited
- In middle of active development
- During urgent fixes

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Set Expectations

**Before starting, explicitly state:**

```
🔍 Starting Code Review

This will be a thorough, unhurried analysis.
I will NOT make any changes during this review.
All issues found will be documented for fixing in a separate session.
Taking my time to be comprehensive...
```

### Step 1: Load Context and Standards

**Read these files:**
- context/CODE_STYLE.md - Know the standards
- context/ARCHITECTURE.md - Understand design
- context/DECISIONS.md - Know past choices
- context/KNOWN_ISSUES.md - Aware of existing issues
- context/.context-config.json - User preferences

**Internalize standards:**
- Simplicity above all
- No temporary fixes
- Root cause solutions only
- Surgical code changes
- Full code flow tracing

### Step 2: Analyze Project Structure

**Scan directory structure:**
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | head -50
ls -la src/ app/ lib/ components/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Identify areas to review:**
- Core business logic
- API routes/endpoints
- Data handling
- UI components
- Utilities and helpers
- Configuration files
- Test coverage

**Create review checklist:**
- [ ] All major code areas identified
- [ ] Priority areas noted
- [ ] Scope is clear

### Step 3: Code Quality Analysis

Review each area systematically. **NO CHANGES - ONLY ANALYSIS**

Use specialized checklists for thoroughness:
- **Security:** `.claude/checklists/security.md`
- **Accessibility:** `.claude/checklists/accessibility.md`
- **SEO:** `.claude/checklists/seo-review.md`
- **Performance:** `.claude/checklists/performance.md`

**9. TypeScript Configuration** (if TypeScript project)
- **ACTION:** Read tsconfig.json to verify settings
- Strict mode enabled? (`"strict": true`)
- No implicit any? (`"noImplicitAny": true` or covered by strict)
- Strict null checks? (`"strictNullChecks": true` or covered by strict)
- Other strict flags appropriate for project?
- **IMPORTANT:** Always verify actual tsconfig.json content before claiming issues

**Document findings:**
```markdown
### [Category] Issues

**[ID]: [Issue Title]**
- Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- Location: file.ts:123-145
- Issue: [What's wrong]
- Impact: [Why it matters]
- Root Cause: [Why it happened]
- Suggestion: [How to fix]
- Effort: [Time estimate]
```

### Step 4: Identify Patterns and Root Causes

**Look for systemic issues:**
- Same mistake repeated across files?
- Architectural flaw causing problems?
- Missing knowledge/skills?
- Technical debt accumulated?

**Categorize issues:**
- **Quick wins:** Easy to fix, high impact
- **Refactoring needed:** Architectural changes
- **Technical debt:** Accumulated problems

### Step 5: Check Against KNOWN_ISSUES.md

**Cross-reference:**
- [ ] Are documented issues actually issues?
- [ ] Are there undocumented issues?
- [ ] Have documented issues been fixed?
- [ ] Are severities accurate?

**Update understanding:**
- Note issues to add to KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- Note issues to remove (if fixed)
- Adjust severities based on findings

### Step 6: Generate Comprehensive Report

Create detailed report in `artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-review.md`:

## Review Checklist

- [✅] All major areas reviewed
- [✅] Issues categorized by severity
- [✅] Root causes identified
- [✅] Suggestions provided
- [✅] No changes made to code
- [✅] Report is actionable
```

**IMPORTANT**: After completing the analysis above, AUTOMATICALLY save the report to a file using the bash code below:

```bash
# Auto-generate report file
echo ""
echo "💾 Saving detailed report..."

# Detect session number from SESSIONS.md
SESSION_NUM=$(grep -c "^## Session" context/SESSIONS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

# Get current date
REVIEW_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Create directory
mkdir -p artifacts/code-reviews

# Generate report filename
REPORT_FILE="artifacts/code-reviews/session-${SESSION_NUM}-review.md"

# Write the comprehensive report from Step 6 above to the file
# (Copy the entire report content from Step 6 into this file)
# Replace placeholders:
#   - [N] with $SESSION_NUM
#   - YYYY-MM-DD with $REVIEW_DATE
#   - Fill in actual findings, grades, metrics from the analysis

echo "✅ Report saved to: $REPORT_FILE"
echo ""
echo "📄 You can view the detailed report at: $REPORT_FILE"
```

**Note**: The report content written to `$REPORT_FILE` should be the complete analysis from Step 6, replacing `[N]` placeholders with actual values (session number, date, findings, etc.).

### Step 7: Report Completion

**Console output:**

```
✅ Code Review Complete

**Report saved to:** artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-review.md

**Summary:**
- Grade: B+
- Critical Issues: 1
- High Priority: 3
- Medium Priority: 7
- Low Priority: 12

**Top 3 Recommendations:**
1. Fix SQL injection in search API (CRITICAL)
2. Add unit tests for authentication (HIGH)

2. Prioritize fixes with user
3. Run /save-context
4. Address issues in separate session

⚠️ Remember: NO changes were made during review.
All issues documented for fixing later.
```

### Step 8: Integration & Actionability

**IMPORTANT**: This step makes findings actionable by integrating with the context system and generating tasks.

#### 8.1: Prepare Issues JSON

Create a JSON file with all issues found in the review:

```bash
# Create JSON from review findings
cat > artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-issues.json <<'EOF'
[
  {
    "id": "C1",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "message": "[Issue description]",
    "file": "path/to/file.ts",
    "line": 123,
    "category": "Security",
    "impact": "[Why this matters]"
  },
  // ... all issues from review
]
EOF
```

**Include all issues** from the review report (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

#### 8.2: Load Helper Functions

```bash
# Source the code review helpers
source scripts/code-review-helpers.sh
source scripts/common-functions.sh
```

#### 8.3: Smart Grouping & TodoWrite Tasks

Offer to create TodoWrite tasks from findings:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 ACTIONABLE TASKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Found 42 issues (3 critical, 5 high, 34 medium/low)

Create TodoWrite tasks for critical and high priority issues? (Y/n) >
```

If user says Yes:

```bash
# Group similar issues
group_similar_issues \
  "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-issues.json" \
  "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-grouped.json"

# Generate TodoWrite tasks (CRITICAL + HIGH)
generate_todowrite_tasks \
  "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-grouped.json" \
  "HIGH" \
  "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-tasks.md"
```

Then display the generated tasks:

```
🧠 Smart grouping detected:
   - 25 similar errors: Missing @testing-library/jest-dom type definitions
   - 12 similar errors: Unused imports
   - 5 unique errors

Creating 7 grouped tasks:

Critical Issues (3):
✅ [pending] Fix SQL injection in search API (api/search.ts:123)
✅ [pending] Add rate limiting to auth endpoints (3 files affected)
✅ [pending] Remove hardcoded secrets from config (config.ts:89)

High Priority (4):
✅ [pending] Fix missing type definitions for @testing-library/jest-dom (25 files)
✅ [pending] Remove unused imports (12 files)
✅ [pending] Add error handling to async operations (api/users.ts:456)
✅ [pending] Fix Decimal type handling (utils/math.ts:78)

Total: 7 actionable tasks created from 42 findings

💡 Run /save to persist tasks to SESSIONS.md
```

#### 8.4: Context Integration

Offer to add critical findings to context system:

```
Add critical issues to context/KNOWN_ISSUES.md? (Y/n) >
```

If user says Yes:

```bash
# Find context directory
CONTEXT_DIR=$(find_context_dir)

# Add critical issues to KNOWN_ISSUES.md
add_to_known_issues \
  "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-issues.json" \
  "$CONTEXT_DIR/KNOWN_ISSUES.md" \
  "[N]" \
  "../artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-review.md" \
  "CRITICAL"
```

Show confirmation:

```
✅ Added 3 critical issues to KNOWN_ISSUES.md:
   - SQL injection vulnerability in search API
   - Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints
   - Hardcoded secrets in configuration
```

Then offer STATUS.md update:

```
Update context/STATUS.md with review summary? (Y/n) >
```

If user says Yes:

```bash
# Update STATUS.md
update_status_summary \
  "$CONTEXT_DIR/STATUS.md" \
  "[N]" \
  "[Grade]" \
  "[Critical count]" \
  "[High count]" \
  "[Medium count]" \
  "../artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-review.md"
```

Show confirmation:

```
✅ Updated STATUS.md under "Recent Changes":

### Code Review - Session [N] (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Grade:** B (needs improvement before production)
**Critical Issues:** 3 🔴
**High Priority:** 5 ⚠️
**Full Report:** [Code Review Details](../artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-review.md)
```

#### 8.5: Review History Tracking

Automatically create/update review history:

```bash
# Update INDEX.md (always run, no prompt needed)
create_review_history \
  "artifacts/code-reviews/INDEX.md" \
  "[N]" \
  "[Grade]" \
  "[Critical count]" \
  "[High count]" \
  "[Medium count]" \
  "[Low count]" \
  "[Files reviewed]" \
  "session-[N]-review.md"
```

#### 8.6: Comparison with Previous Review

If previous review exists, show comparison:

```bash
# Find latest previous review
PREVIOUS_REVIEW=$(find_latest_review)

if [ -n "$PREVIOUS_REVIEW" ]; then
  # Compare with previous
  compare_with_previous \
    "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-issues.json" \
    "$PREVIOUS_REVIEW" \
    "artifacts/code-reviews/session-[N]-comparison.json"

  # Display comparison (read the JSON and format nicely)
fi
```

Example output if previous review exists:

## Important Guidelines

### The "No Changes" Rule

**Every temptation follows this pattern:**
1. You notice something fixable
2. You think "this is quick and easy"
3. You're tempted to fix it now
4. **You must resist and document instead**

**See full explanation:** `.claude/docs/code-review-guide.md` - "The No Changes Rule"

### Taking Your Time

User runs this when they have time. Be thorough:
- Read code carefully
- Trace through logic
- Consider edge cases
- Question assumptions

**Missing issues is worse than taking time.**

### Grading Rubric

- **A (90-100%):** Excellent - follows all standards, well-tested, secure, minimal tech debt
- **B (80-89%):** Good - mostly follows standards, minor issues, decent coverage
- **C (70-79%):** Adequate - some violations, medium issues, gaps in testing
- **D (60-69%):** Poor - many violations, high priority issues, major gaps
- **F (<60%):** Failing - critical security issues, no tests, unsustainable debt

**Full rubric:** `.claude/docs/code-review-guide.md` - "Grading Rubric"

## Error Handling

**If scope too large:** Report it, suggest reviewing in chunks
**If unfamiliar technology:** Note in report, focus on general principles
**If can't determine issue:** Document uncertainty, suggest investigation

## Success Criteria

✅ Comprehensive analysis completed
✅ All issues documented with details
✅ No code changes made
✅ Clear, actionable recommendations
✅ User knows what to fix and in what order

**See:** `.claude/docs/code-review-guide.md` - "Success Criteria"
